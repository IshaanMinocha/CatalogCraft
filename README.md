## Problem
The challenge is to develop innovative solutions that leverage cutting-edge technologies to seamlessly digitalize and enhance product catalogs, offering a user-friendly experience for sellers and seller apps.
Consider a sample catalog with at least 1000 SKUs, with attributes such as SKU id, product name, description, price, image, inventory, colour, size, brand, etc.
This catalog is to be digitized using a combination of intuitive interfaces such as text / voice / image input, with text & voice input using any of the Indic languages.
In some cases, a combination of these interfaces are required to digitize an SKU e.g. scan image which pre-fills the product name from the repository, with the remaining attributes filled using text or voice input.
